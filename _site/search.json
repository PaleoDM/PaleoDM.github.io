    "text": "MACHINE LEARNING COMPUTER VISION MODEL\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\n\n\n\nCLIENT\nHefner Museum of Natural History\n\n\nGOAL\nUse AI to streamline the identification of museum specimens (mammal skulls) from photographs.\n\n\nPRIMARY TOOLS\nPython, FastAI, Gradio, HuggingFace\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe client serves as a physical repository for tens of thousands of museum specimens, including hundreds of mammal skulls. These skulls occupy a large amount of physical space and pose unique storage challenges for the client. The client requires a solution for quickly identifying the type of skull in order to streamline its association with the relevant digital metadata.\n###PRODUCT Our team developed a working prototype of a computer vision model powered by AI. The model received user input (photographs of mammal skulls) and correctly classifies them into mammalian Orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n\nTRAINING DATA SETS\n\nThe Challenge: The computer vision model (ResNet18) requires a sizeable library of training data.\n The Solution: Source photographs of mammal skulls from publicly available museum repositories available online, including the Smithsonian NMNH and the London NHM.\n\n\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nThe Challenge: The client needs a fast and agile tool that works in a collection space: often on the move and away from the office.

They have designed several navigation prototypes and conducted multiple rounds of user testing for each. The client needs insightful data analysis that converts data into actionable decision making.\n\n\nPRODUCT\nOur team helped the client formulate and test hypotheses to compare user performance across prototypes. We produced a data report that identified which prototypes performed best. Our work revealed critical patterns across user operating system and screen size. We consulted on design modifications to maximize the client‚Äôs desired metrics while minimizing error rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n\nDATA OUTLIERS\n\nThe Challenge: The client‚Äôs chosen user testing platform failed to identify key outliers, resulting in spurious preliminary conclusions.\n The Solution: We identified and removed notable outliers, transformed the data to bolster its statistical power, and consulted on other details of the experimental design to maximize the data‚Äôs utility.\n\n\n\nDIVERSE SCREEN SIZES\n\nThe Challenge: The users participating in the tests used a myriad of screen sizes and resolutions, including sizes which were not considered when designing the Navigation.\n The Solution: We tested for anomalous patterns across different screen sizes and identified key breakpoints where error rates jumped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n\nADVISE THE CLIENT\n\nOur results demonstrate that users‚Äô performance is significantly improved by Prototype E.

We will further explore the data to identify additional patterns that may inform the client‚Äôs choice."

These games often have complex rulesets, which are stored in a Wiki. The client would like users to be able to quickly query the Wiki for rules, rather than needing to leave Discord to search for the information themselves.\n\n\nPRODUCT\nDeveloped and launched a fully operational Discord bot (The RELIC) that links to the curated Wiki for each game‚Äôs rulesets. Users can call the bot with command inputs and receive the corresponding passage of the rules for quick reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n\nMULTIPLE GAME WIKIs\n\nThe Challenge: The client‚Äôs rulesets are scattered across multiple different Wikis for each game.\n The Solution: Create a master Wiki that automatically pulls updates from the individual Wiki pages and can be queried individually by The RELIC Discord bot.\n\n\n\nUSER-SPECIFIC VERSIONING\n\nThe Challenge: The client wants different groups of users to be able to modify a game‚Äôs rulesets to fit their specific needs.\n The Solution: Create game-specific Wikis and prompt the users to select their Wiki of choice when first engaging The RELIC bot. Users can then modify their Wikis as needed without pushing changes to the entire server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\nNow that The RELIC is operational, what‚Äôs next?\n\n\nCLOUD HOSTING\n\nHosting The RELIC on a cloud-based platform will ensure that the bot is always active, not just when a Discord moderator is available to host.\n\n\n\nDICE ROLLER\n\nTabletop games frequently employ dice rolling mechanics. Adding a dice rolling functionality keeps users from leaving the platform for other tools."

Their mission is to encourage and enable data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions. The client requests a way to predict potential fossil localities to discover new fossils.\n\n\nPRODUCT\nOur team developed a predictive model using marine mammals as study organisms. The model uses the geospatial coordinates of all known marine mammal fossils and identifies key geographic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of fossil localities. The model successfully forecasts locations with a high probability of yielding new fossil discoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n\nDIFFERENT ORGANISMS\n\nThe Challenge: Different groups of organisms have their distributions influenced by completely different factors.\n The Solution: Develop independent models based on organisms with similar ecologies and geographic distributions to avoid homogeneity of the model.\n\n\n\nINHERENT BIAS\n\nThe Challenge: Fossil distribution is heavily biased by socioeconomic factors, such as GDP, which do not reflect a true biological or geologic signal.  The Solution: Standardize the dataset for GDP and other socioeconomic factors to avoid implicit Northern Hemisphere bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\nNow that we‚Äôve delivered the model to the client, what‚Äôs next?\n\n\nEXPAND THE SCOPE\n\nMarine mammals were an ideal starting point because their distribution is easily modeled to modern coastlines. Now, we can expand to other fossil groups, including terrestrial organisms.\n\n\n\nUNITE DATASETS\n\nThe distribution of fossils is just the first step. A major factor in being able to excavate fossils is the surface exposure of the bedrock. By combining our model with geologic maps from the USGS, we‚Äôll be able to forecast high-value localities for paleontologists to prospect."

In the years since, Sensei Carlos has dedicated himself to perfecting his craft and his mastery of Tai Chuan Do, while training broadly to better understand the origins and inspirations for the style. In 2017, he founded a dojo in Columbia, Maryland. Now living in Cincinnati, Sensei Carlos hopes to continue his martial arts journey by bringing Tai Chuan Do Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAI CHUAN DO KARATE\n\n\nABOUT TAI CHUAN DO\n\nTai Chuan Do Karate was founded by Grand Master Ken Champ on September 30, 1977. Grand Master Champ sought to combine the myriad of different styles into a combat art form that emphasized the grace and discipline of traditional martial styles with the combat utility of the fighting styles emerging in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nCODE OF ETHICS\n\n\nREAD THE CODE\n\nAs a martial artist, my fundamental duty is to serve GOD and MANKIND; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception; the weak against oppression or intimidation; the peaceful against violence or disorder; and to respect the Constitutional Rights of all men to liberty, equality, and justice.\nI promise, I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all; maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others, honest in thought and deed in my personal life. I will be exemplary in observing the laws of the land and the regulations of Tai Chuan Do Schools, respectful of the other students and instructors.\nAs a Tai Chuan Do student/instructor, I shall regard the discharge of my training. Recognizing my responsibilities as a trust; I shall study diligently and pay sincere attention to self-improvement; shall strive to make the best possible application of science to the art of self-defense; and shall strive for effective leadership and personal happiness in the field of human relationships. I shall appreciate the importance and responsibility of my rank and training and hold it to the most honorable high standards."
