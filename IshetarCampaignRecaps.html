<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="levelup3">Begin Level 3</h3>
<p>We opened with a short monologue:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s been seven years.<br>
Seven years since our eyes last turned to this far corner of Astoria—to the broken landmasses of Wanun, and the long, cragged tendril of continent known in the common tongue as Ekkorai.</p>
<p>Seven years since a small, stubborn outpost called Ishetar first rose from the mist and the stone.</p>
<p>But on Astoria, fifty-four years have passed since our heroes first landed on those rocky cliffs.<br>
And just over three centuries since the gods and devils tore themselves from this place in a cataclysmic truce, leaving the land to heal—or fester—in the hands of the Fae.</p>
<p>In those fifty-four years, the heartlands of Astoria have pressed forward—machines, scholars, armies.<br>
Ekkorai, though?<br>
Remote.<br>
Untamed.<br>
Still dangerously, stubbornly wild.</p>
<p>Ishetar has grown stronger in our absence—its people harder, its fields broader, its voice sharper against the founding Aroiin Empire.<br>
Tensions now stand at an all-time high.</p>
<p>Only one thing remains of the old alliance: a granite monument perched high above the beaches, weathered by salt and wind.<br>
A life-sized sculpture frozen in battle—five heroes locked against a monstrous, writhing sea star.<br>
Transmuted from clay to stone, a gift of great honor from the former Duchess of Prusca—a tribute few now stop to remember.</p>
<p>Ishetar balances on the edge of a blade:<br>
Grown strong enough to dream of independence.<br>
Yet surrounded by a land that remembers the chaos of gods and devils far better than mortals ever could.</p>
<p>And so we return…</p>
<p>To cliffs choked with mist.<br>
To roads half-swallowed by wilds.<br>
To old names whispered in new shadows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, we saw a day in the life of each of our new heroes.</p>
<p>We began with Vicas, the older green dragonborn. A man of medicine. Not the priestly kind. The bandage and bone saw kind. We watched Azrael, our young lad of an Aasimar, arrive at Vicas’s house and let himself in just as Vicas was fixing up an old man’s shoulder. Vicas, covered in blood, assured Azrael that “it don’t belong to no one who needs it” and set about inspecting the lad’s “cut” on his thigh. Satisfied it was a mere flesh wound, the two bantered about for a moment, before the sound of activity at the gate called Vicas to action.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in town, we saw Rooker, the old curmudgeon from the local mage academy, in a heated argument with their administrative assistant, an older tabaxi woman named Sombra. As the two raised their voices, and their contempt, it soon became clear that Vicas wouldn’t be filling out the proper forms for an overdue library book, and Sombra wouldn’t be letting him here the end. Vicas stormed off for a cigarette and a long walk, and serendipity would bring him awfully near the south gate…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we saw Lyra, the wood elven cleric in plate armor wend her tea card, pulled by the ever cheerful dire badger named Sprout, into Ishetar and take up brewing tea and listening to folks. We met a young woman, mayhaps 16, asking for advice about whether to remain in Ishetar or sail west to study in the capital. Lyra avoided giving answers, but listened with a kind ear and asked probing questions while the young girl sat with Sprout for a time. In the end, her frustration turned towards serenity and determination, just as the call from the South Gate went out…</p>
<p>And finally, we saw Thump, our halfling druid, making his early morning rounds through Ishetar, preparing all of the foliage for Autumn. A dutiful and serious affair, Thump was pruning back bushes, trimming trees, and preparing all the perennials for their dormant cycle. As he moved to the edges of town with larger trees, he carefully guided their color transition into autumn colors, and brought a small gust to usher along those ready to fall. We saw Thump pass the bakery—one of the few businesses open so early—and heard the kindly baker tell her two children to “leave a biscuit out for him dears. That’s the painter: he paints the Fall colors on the leaves this time of year. Do be sure to go admire his work this evening dearies!” And with that, Thump made his way towards the gate, intending to have a nice mid-morning nap in his grove.</p>
<p>As our heroes convened at the Gates, they saw commotion. Two riders, coming in hot from the South road, riding like danger pursued them. And sure enough, large winged creatures, like large bats, were dive bombing the riders and harrying the two. When one of the creatures finally undercut the legs of one of the horses, rider and horse each went toppling over, revealing a young woman clutching an infant to her chest. Our heroes sprung into action…</p>
<p>And promptly missed every roll they made for a round. By the end of the first round, several devilish creatures known as Imps have encircled the rider. A spined devil approached them from behind, and puddles of evil, called Lemures, were moving towards the gate. Oh, and a 9 year old boy had been stung by an imps tail and was unconscious.</p>
<p>Things went much better after that though! Azrael and Vicas managed to fight their way to the woman with the infant. Though she refused to hand the child over to Vicas, the two were able to draw fire and dodge most of the attacks, severely mitigating the danger to the civilians. Lyra used a healing spell on the young boy, and then cast bless on the party to great effect, while Thump and Rooker rained spells from the back line.</p>
<p>As the enemies closed in around our heroes, Lyra channeled the sun’s holy power in this mid morning day, and unleashed a divine blast that absolutely destroyed all four imps and all four lemures. Then, Azrael and Vicas converged on the spined devil and did great violence to it…only for it to explode into a hoard of lemures! Thankfully, they quickly cleaned up, with Thump and Lyra landing the killing damage after Rooker pumped another eldritch blast into it.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fight, our heroes caught their breath for a short rest at Dirty Gerty’s. The traveler was a woman named Meris, her sister in law Talene, and her 9 year old son Kivan. With them was her 1 year old daughter Ellie. She explained that Ellie had been born an Aasimar, something quite rate in Ekkorai, and that she had been told Ellie was cursed. Indeed, Ellie bore a strange birthmark on her neck and cheek, and had reacted strangely to divine magic during the fight. Meris explained that sometimes it was helpful magic, but at other times could be dangerous.</p>
<p>She and her husband had preyed endlessly for a cure, and finally been given a vision—each having the same dream on the same night. An androgynous figure appeared to them in a hood, beautiful and powerful and whispering honeyed words of understanding and hope. They had promised they could help Ellie, and directed them to a shrine north of Ishetar where an ancient oracle had once granted boons for the locals.</p>
<p>The logging settlement where they lived—overseen by the Turquoise Timber Trust—had refused to send workers on a wild goose chase. And so Meris’s husband Dalrick and his brother Bran had taken the two eldest, a 14 year old girl named Jora and a 12 year old boy named Mickell. They had gone to the oracle to seek the cure, but had failed to return. The trip should have been a short one—doable in one day from Ishetar. But now Meris fears her family has met an unfortunate fate, and she’s come to beg adventurers to find her husband and oldest children. Meris and Talene offered their life savings, and the two horses stolen from the logging camp. They even agreed to work off a debt on top of it if necessary.</p>
<p>Our heroes didn’t seem entirely comfortable with the idea of taking money, but they were all in on helping. And because they were concerned about the timeframe, they’ve elected to try to leave now while the sun is still high and they can get back before sunset. All the better, for the Gatekeeper’s Remembrance Day is only 3 nights away, and Meris and Talene desperately need closer before then, lest they fail to leave offerings for their recently departed loved ones.</p>
<p>We join our heroes mid day on the 10th, as they leave Ishetar on what they hope will be a quick and calming hike.</p>

<h1>Session 2—May 4th, 2025</h1>
<section id="th-of-obitris-1136-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="th-of-obitris-1136-1">10th of Obitris, 1136</h2>
<p>We rejoined our heroes finishing up at the Dirty Gerty tavern, making their final preparations to go look for Dalric and Bran Caldrow, and the young children Jora and Mickell. As they finalized these preparations, it became clear that there was a choice of route to make:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Travel along the cliffs, which were sure to be direct and fast, with no chance of getting lost, but full of terrible danger.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Travel along the old hunting and trapping paths, which would leave somepossibility of getting lost and would add to their travel time, but would theoretically face less danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, they chose the hunting paths, in part because they feared that their mounts wouldn’t make the journey cliff side (spoiler alert, they were right). Thump transformed into a majestic, roan-colored elk, and the rest took the ponies, and off they went.</p>
<p>It was not too long before they found themselves coming upon a set of Ogres, of which they’d heard rumors. The ogre called out, insisting on paying a toll. When they asked how much, it stated simply “two”. Rooker thought this entirely reasonable, but it soon became apparent that they meant “two people”. Azrael tried to intimidate the monsters with a drawing on their ferocity, but the ogre was flattered by the image and insisted that Azrael now belonged to him and kept calling Azrael “his new son”.</p>
<p>Predictably, violence broke out, and it proved quite dangerous. In the fray, Rooker placed down a crucial Darkness spell that allowed several of them to hide from the worst of the attacks. Azrael and Vicas did their best to front line, ducking and dodging around most of the attacks. Thump and Lyra provided critical support from the back line: Lyra trying to ration few spell slots while Thump put one of them to sleep.</p>
<p>Things turned quickly when the sleeping ogre awoke, and another landed a massive crit on Azrael that missed killing them by a single hit point. That spurred our heroes to decisive action—Lyra brought Azrael back from the brink with a healing word and together they laid waste to the last remaining ogre.</p>
<p>As they rested, our heroes settled in for a chat. Lyra invoked a prayer of healing, allowing them all to take a short rest in only ten minutes time, and restored a fair number of hit points. Vicas administered to his allies with healing hands, while the rest investigated the ogres, who had unusual branding burned into their skin in the form of celestial and infernal runes. Our heroes didn’t know what to make of it, but knew well enough to know it wasn’t done by a physical brand, but by magic. They were disturbed.</p>
<p>When they set off once more, Thump led them finally off the path and towards the shores. As they strayed from the path, Thump found a small roadside offering marker—simple little statues where travelers make offerings for the road. Every culture differs slightly, but typically folks leave small tokens or burn a candle or make an offering for save travels. Thump chided Rooker for typically pilfering whatever coins have been left, and druidcraft a lovely flower into it as an offering.</p>
<p>This triggered a magical communication with the Oracle of the shrine, who implored our heroes that time was short. Her wards were failing, and they would leak wild divinity into the world around Ishetar. She could help them prepare, but only if they hurried, for Vessan had nearly drained her of life and the civilians would be next. In thanks, Lyra cast light upon the vessel, and was rewarded with Quetzi’s boon—a one time use of the Bless spell, cast at 2nd level, as a bonus action.</p>
<p>Now our heroes made double time, and soon arrived at the shrine itself. Old and forgotten, but the stone still remembered their old days. As they approached, they found four civilians (2 adult men and 2 adolescents) tied around a stone dais bearing a beaten and unconscious draconic creature. Before they could approach, Vessan made their appearance.</p>
<p>A tall, slender and gaunt androgynous figure came into view, with skin the color of blue-purple slate and eyes that glowed of pure light. They despaired at first, to learn that it was a group of adventurers who had come, and not the infant Ellie. They despaired more still to learn that this was why their “children” had not returned with the infant.</p>
<p>Our heroes set about trying to create an ambush for Azrael. Rooker got Vessan talking about their plan, and it soon became clear that they felt themselves a servant of the gods who had faithfully waited all this time for their return. They thought the child a sign that the gods were returning to restart the crusade, and they aimed to “fill the child with divinity” and for her to “rupture the divine energy across the land”. Rooker asked what “rupture” meant and was assured it would be “wet”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyra had deduced that this was a twisted and sick creature—they were never mortal to begin with and centuries abandoned to this land had twisted them to something most wretched and foul. Lyra introduced Azrael, who suddenly garnered all of Vessan’s attention as a potential new vessel. Meanwhile, Lyra and Vicas unbound the civilians and primed them to flee upon a signal. And then, Azrael struck a surprise blow.</p>
<p>Vessan wept, globs of bight melancholy as the psychic blade pierced their body. And then, they exploded into divine light, reconstituting as a magnificent giant elk and 4 sparks of divinity. Combat broke out, with Lyra taking a mighty wound from the elk after dealing some damage of her own. Then Vicas closed ranks and decimated what remained of the elk. The wisps of divinity however, set about with healing spells, and soon the battle was afoot. Lyra used their channel divinity radiant blast, and the elk fell once more. Then everyone else went to work on the wisps. Azrael landed a massive crit, Rooker a max damage eldritch blast, and Thump landed a crit of his own before Vicas cleaned up the rest. In the end, Lyra convened on the final wisp with her mace, dealing the exact damage necessary to kill it.</p>
<p>We join our heroes in the late afternoon on the 10th of Obitris, having rescued the civilians but still needing to deal with a dying oracle and, ideally, make their way home before nightfall. And what of Vessan, who seems to have been felled so easily? Perhaps…too easily for one so long-lived and determined?</p>

<h1>Session 3—May 10th, 2025</h1>
<section id="th-of-obitris-1136-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="th-of-obitris-1136-2">10th of Obitris, 1136</h2>
<p>We picked up with our heroes <em>in media res</em>, as they had just finished rescuing the Caldrows and a strange, slender draconic entity named Quetzi. Vicas checked on the Couatl, who confirmed that she had been the one who spoke with them at the shrine and that she could scarcely believe they’d arrived in time to find her alive. She also delivered some difficult news:</p>
<p>This location was what one might call a “well of divinity”. She didn’t know the specifics, but she had been set here to guard it and hold its raw, divine magic semi-dormant. Wards had been scrawled all over her shrine to do just that. But they had <em>never</em> been meant to be permanent. And now, nearly four centuries later, they were finally wearing out.</p>
<p>“What”, our players had asked, “might we do about that?” If the wards cannot be restored and resealed, can something else be done with the raw and wild divine power? Quetzi informed them that yes, but fortunately they had already stopped it. That had been what Vessan intended, after all. To use the child Ellie as a vessel, turning this well into a land mine. She was grateful they had stopped it, but the magic would leak across the land and bring new and wild changes all the same.</p>
<p>While Vicas, Lyra, and Rooker helped Quetzi and asked her for this knowledge, Azrael had found himself with a bit of a shadow—the eldest Caldrow, a girl of about 15 named Jora—had taken to following Azrael around and trying to copy his swordsmanship with her machete. The two sparred verbally for a bit, during which Azrael urged her to “focus” the anger. The message was…received with all the grace of an adolescent girl tasked with being the oldest and strongest of four siblings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young boy Mickell, about 12, had been mimicking Rooker’s detailed journaling and sketching of the creatures he’d seen and the monsters they’d fought. This was advantageous, as it put them near the conversation when Thump turned to examine Quetzi properly.</p>
<p>Thump soon discerned that Quetzi was, despite Vicas and Lyra healing her, dying nonetheless. Her spirit was tethered to the wards, and Vessan had been bleeding her for some weeks now. She was weak of body and of spirit. Thump lit her a fire, and the Couatl leaped for it like it was a warm bath. Thump and Vicas did their best to discern what, if anything, could be done.</p>
<p>They concluded it was impossible. Or at least, it should be. Helping Quetzi would require someone skilled in all three domains of magic—arcane, divine, and primal. And beyond that, it would require a skilled surgeon and someone to wield a scalpel that cuts soul rather than flesh. Except, even as they said it, they realized it might just be crazy enough to work. The only hang up? It would need a rare material component—a source of divine fire.</p>
<p>This was where young Mickell, came in handy! “I know just the thing,” he said tugging on Lyra’s sleeve. “There’s a Hell Hound in the forest on our way home. The trees told me. They were angry about it too.” Our heroes were understandably perplexed. Rooker asked if the child could literally hear the trees, but he explained it was more of a low rumble he felt in his toes. Thump understood.</p>
<p>And so our heroes carried Quetzi and escorted the Caldrows back to Ishetar after a night at the altar. And when they’d seen them to safety, they turned right back around to track down a den of hell hounds. The found it right quick too, with Thump’s expert directions. Soon they were assaulting the den, and fighting their way through death dogs whose very bite oozed sepsis.</p>
<p>Vicas valiantly ran to the front line, only to find himself overwhelmed by toxins so noxious even his own bloodline wretched. Thankfully, Vicas’s strong positioning and knack for ducking and dodging prevented any one else from getting bit and poisoned. Our heroes pressed on into the cave and found two more death dogs, and two hell hounds. And the battle was on!</p>
<p>Before things could get too bad though, Thump casted a massive spike growth that forced all of the dogs to deal themselves enormous amounts of damage just to even join the fray. It was pretty inspired, and worked double when Vicas ran ahead and dragged one of the dogs <em>back through the damn thorns</em> for even more damage!</p>
<p>In spite of it all, our heroes soon found themselves fighting for their lives. Vicas was downed twice, and Azrael fell once as well. Thankfully, Rooker managed to blast one and Thump another, leaving Lyra openings to heal everyone and turn the tide back in their direction. In the end, Azrael managed to down the last beast, giving everyone some much needed respite.</p>
<p>At the back of the cave, Rooker found two wounded humanoid creatures. He spoke to them telepathically, and learned that they had been badly poisoned and were biding their time. When asked if Rooker had slain the monsters expecting anything in return, Rooker answered no, prompting the poisoned creatures to declare that they thus were not in our party’s debt.</p>
<p>We ended their with our heroes needing to deal with the two, apparently fae creatures, and harvest the hearts of these hell hounds for their ritual to help Quetzi.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="th-of-obitris-1136-3">10th of Obitris, 1136</h2>
<p>We joined our heroes on the 10th of Obitris, and picked right up in the den of the hell hounds, where Rooker had sort of just stepped in it with two strange, seemingly fae creatures. Our heroes set about trying to do three very important things all at once: heal their wounded, harvest the hell hound hearts before it was too late, and engage with these fae entities in a way that didn’t leave them in debt for life. It was…harrowing.</p>
<p>Lyra took point negotiating with the fae, whom they learned are not technically fae. Not in the strictest sense. Lyra learned that, when the divine war finally ended and the agents of the gods fled this land, there were mortals left behind. Mortals who suddenly found themselves in a land influenced by the fae as if it were their own. These two, who called them selves Minor Key and Major Chord, explained it thus: if elves were once fae who are now mostly folk, then they are folk who are not mostly fae.</p>
<p>More improtantly, these two entities were worried about our heroes trapping them with word play, but had little interest in doing it to our heroes. Once manners were properly established, they were happy to dispense with the cumbersome trappings of fae word play.</p>
<p>From Minor Sing and Major Chord, our heroes learned that Vessan had once been a champion of the Archeart, and that in the centures of solitude he had filled the hole with other voices. These two, who refer to their people as Thornsong and claim to listen to the songs of the stone, explained that the changing dynamics in this land had “stirred the stone-sleepers” and that this region’s raw divinity made the stone “sing too loud”.</p>
<p>In the end, they used lesser restoration to cure Vicas of his poisoned condition, and agreed to speak highly of Ishetar to their brethern, in the hopes that Ishetar might find more local allies in Ekkorai. Meanwhile, Vicas and Thump were meticulously harvesting the hearts from these hell hounds, and Thump absolutely nailed it (natural 20!). Having gotten their quest item, the heroes parted ways with Major Key and Minor Chord, Vicas all too happy to do so, and returned back to Quetzi to save her before it would be too late.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, Vicas sent for Sombra and as many books as she could spare, and Quetzi was taken to Thump’s sacred grove. There, they placed her upon a dais beneath a beautiful maple tree, ancient and gnarled around the old stone. And they set about the grizzly work of ground breaking, world shaking, rules-defying magic. All in a day’s work.</p>
<p>Vicas led the first part of the ritual, which might have been the most vital (but don’t tell him that). It involved suffusing the ritual site with enough magic for everything else to work. He consulted every textbook and tapped into every ounce of mana left in his body. And on an assisted roll of 33, he managed to pump into raw arcana into the ritual circle to super charge the space. <em>For these efforts, they were able to precisely manipulate the flow of magic.</em></p>
<p>Thump stepped in next, with the difficult task of aligning this raw arcana to the natural magics of the land, lest it become too unstable. This was difficult work, but Thump had spent years in Ishetar already, slowly caring and cultivating for this most sacred of places. He knew the maple’s roots well, and with an assisted roll of 23, was able to bend the arcana to the network of tree roots. <em>For these efforts, the magic was stabilized, preventing the most serious of potential consequences.</em></p>
<p>Next came Lyra, who was tasked with aligning these magics with the divinity of a celestial being. Lyra took great care to brew just the right cup of tea, and passed it amongst them all to bolster their efforts as they worked. There was prayer, yes, but also offerings, in just the right way and at just the right moments. And on an assisted roll of 27, she succesfully aligned Quetzi’s divine nature to the magic of the ritual. <em>For these efforts, the party gained the capacity to see Quetzi’s soul directly, and at last witnessed the cancerous growth upon it.</em></p>
<p>Vicas stepped up next, with the eyes and hands of a surgeon, knowing that they’d only have one shot at this and that, anything less than 100% removal would likely see it grow back. Vicas took his time, and thanks to the success of the three types of magic rituals, was able to consider Quetzi on a cellular level. With this truest of divine sight, he was able to meticulously identify the nature of every individual cell. And on an assisted roll of 22, he carefully identified precisely which ones to excise. <em>For these efforts, there would be no risk of trimming away too much or too little.</em></p>
<p>And finally came Azrael, the blade. Though he voiced nervousness, Azrael’s hands were steady when he called forth the psychic soul blades. And under Vicas’s watchful eye, he set to work. The job was slow, and tiresome, but with an assisted roll of 28, Azrael executed Vicas’s vision to absolute perfection. <em>For these efforts, Quetzi was given the best possible chance anyone could ask for</em>.</p>
<p>And so she rolled. With a cumulative +8 from the ritual, and a DC of 10, she could only die on a natural one. And as the magic finally ended and began to dissipate back into the earth, as Vicas and Azrael collapsed from the exertion, the ritual was declared a success. Quetzi fell into a deep sleep, likely not to wake for a few days. Meanwhile, Vicas and Sombra exulted at the groundbreaking arcane theory they had just been part of. Lyra silently lamented Sombra’s ambition, but was thankful for the help nonetheless.</p>
<p>And so our heroes broke. They gave Quetzi a few days to rest. She was entrusted to the bakers, of all places, as their furnaces burn the hottest. The Caldrows were reunited and assured that the community would find work for them and, should they stick around long enough, come together to built them a home (though with winter coming on, that would likely wait until Spring). In all, we saw the full community of Ishetar on display—a town with such little use for coin finds other ways to support.</p>
<p>Lady Rowena, youngest daughter of the now late Aroiin Emperor, and holy paladin of the Lawbearer, called our heroes to personally thank them and send them on a new mission. We saw her send emissaries to the Turquoise Timber Trust, hoping to return the horses and “solve” the problem of the Caldrow’s being exiled. Then, she explained to our heroes and many of the town leaders some distressing developments.</p>
<p>Back in the Empire, her brothers, among whom the old lands had been divided, had been feuding, as usual. And now, it seems, they have finally taken up arms and mean to battle over border disputes. Lady Rowena was emphatic—she does not rule Ishetar, but she does represent them to the Empire. And each of her brothers, in their own way, has “declared” her on their side, and aims to drag her in.</p>
<p>Rowena made it clear to the citizens of Ishetar—they would not be joining any battles, nor sending any support to her brothers. She would leave them to squabble among themselves. But in consequence, they should expect no further supply shipments, as all eyes in the Empire turn inward now. Winter is on the horizon, and Ishetar will need to prepare to face it along.</p>
<p>And so with that, she delivered one final request of our heroes. Old treaties from before she arrived in Ishetar outline a trade agreement with a “community of small, plant folk”. In exchange for an annual shipment of dried meats, late in the Autumn, these folk “whisper tidings of Ekkorai at large through the roots of all things”. Lady Rowena was skeptical, but Thump insisted that this treaty must be honored. “Don’t piss off the plants” he chided.</p>
<p>And so Lady Rowena made the ask—the merchant, a halfling by the name of Gambino, had been delayed, and the pass through the hills has frozen early. Someone will need to escort the cart of salted meats to the plant folk, and they’ll have to pass through the Red Vale—a supposedly haunted lowland valley that most prefer to avoid. Small potatoes for our heroes!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="levelup4">Begin Level 4</h3>
<p>We joined our heroes following a long and well deserved rest, in Ishetar proper. We opened with Lyra, having taken a long walk to join Keeper Vespa—the lighthouse keeper and minster of the temple of Pelor in Ishetar. After briefly seeing her husband, Brother Tobias of the only other temple in town, the GateKeeper’s temple, Vespa discussed with Lyra her real worries. Her latest vision had brought her an important realization—without supply of oil from the empire, Ishetar would be unable to keep the light of the lighthouse perpetually lit.</p>
<p>They could switch to firewood, of course, but that does not burn smokeless, nor does it easily last all night. Vespa was concerned, of course, for the lighthouse serves as a beacon for many travelers and wanderers, and she forsees their role becoming ever more important as the region became isolated. Lyra mused on her own capacity to create a perpetual, continual flame, using magic and empowered by a ruby. “We’ll find one and see what we can do”, she assured Vespa. Vespa, not expecting generosity, quipped about passing the offering plate around twice that week.</p>
<p>From there, we saw the rest of the party preparing to embark, with Lady Rowena trying to impress the import of the mission to Vicas. It was undercut a bit by her own clumsy choice of words and Azrael’s direct and brash willingness to challenge authority. In the end, Rowena mildly offended Thump on accident, and left Vicas a tad confused. But the message was ostensibly simple—please find a way to deliver on Ishetar’s deal with the plant folk, but also find a way to renegotiate expectations, because they won’t be able to deliver on the deal again next season.</p>
<p>Then, at long last, we met Pinto Gambino. The party immediately hated him. I swear I have no idea why. I tried to make him funny but kind of an idiot, and somehow immediately they were dunking on him and I was “yes anding” him into a sleeze bag. We leaned into it and soon they had basically adopted a mascot to bully.</p>
<p>They quickly realized that Pinto was a loser, and lying about something or another. Azrael discovered a magically hidden box amidst the supplies, but it was seemingly empty. When he showed it to Lyra, they began scheming a way to force Pinto’s hand. Meanwhile, Vicas continued intimidating the poor chap, until finally they all broke him down just as our party arrived at the margin of the Red Vale</p>
<p>Pinto admitted that he had lost a large shipment owned by the Turquoise Timber Trust, and was now in deep. They’d given him one final chance to make it back and were expecting him to deliver “a magical fragment from a world beyond” by way of this magically protected box. Pinto had no idea what he was looking for, but he was counting on knowing it when he saw it.</p>
<p>Our heroes pressed him to tell them anything else and omit no more information. Pinto vowed exactly that, and triggered a strange magical phenomena. Something magical in the ambient area took his words and magically bound them. For his oath, Pinto was left with his lips fused shut, unable to speak. When Rooker asked him to tell a lie telepathically, Pinto was blasted by psychic damage. The players took note—be careful not to swear any oaths around here.</p>
<p>Satisfied that they didn’t have a dangerous jerk along with them, the party pressed on into the Red Vale. The way forward should have been dangerous and slow, but Thump was <em>absolutely in his element</em>. The party managed to avoid nearly all danger until finally stumbling across a strange, crimson and azure banner stuck in the ground.</p>
<p>Our heroes were hesitant, and tried to find their way around. But their curiosity was peaked, because the soil here where the banner was planted was particularly unusual and different. Azrael, hoping to test out any danger, flung a dagger into the soil, only to find an undead arm throwing it back!</p>
<p>Combat broke out, but it was short lived. Lyra used her turn undead and suddenly all of the most dangerous creatures were fleeing, and the hidden banshee was revealed. The wretched creature tried to debilitate them all with her scream, but it mostly failed and, just like that, it was a battle of blades and blasts. Lyra called the power of Pelor for her divine flash, while Thump parted the clouds to invoke the Moonweaver’s brilliance upon the undead. Not to be outdone, Azrael lit their own divine light, and suddenly Rooker was feeling awfully heretical. Even Vicas found himself relying on his own, strangely magical healing reserve.</p>
<p>As our heroes mopped up, Vicas and Thump followed Rooker’s lead and uncovered a magical spell scroll at the foot of the banner. Then, Thump examined the soil and rolled ungodly high, learning something supremely valuable—the entire Red Vale is one gigantic impact crater from an ancient asteroid or meteoroid, and this soil is a hitherto unknown to science, extra-terrestrial mineral. Thump casually tossed some to Pinto, musing that it may satisfy the terms of his employers.</p>
<p>From there, we arrived at the Vegepygmy village and met their outrider scouts. They…did not speak common, and thing were rough for a little bit, especially because Pinto was still mute. Eventually though, our heroes found common ground around Thump’s smoking pipe. Having made friends, they were taken to Sprigg—the village elder, who thankfully spoke some semblance of common.</p>
<p>We finished with the party preparing for a night of drink and smoke, and the promise of talking business, and renegotiating the deal, in the morning.</p>

<h1>Session 6—June 21st, 2025</h1>
<section id="st-of-obitris-1136" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="st-of-obitris-1136">21st of Obitris, 1136</h2>
<p>We began as our heroes settled into the Vegepygmy village at night, sharing food, smoke, and cultural exchange after their long journey. Azrael spent the evening wrestling sproutlings in a makeshift ring they had built, clearly enjoying playing the role of older sibling and local hero. Lyra and Thump observed the vegepygmies’ unique culinary practices—cooking meat in slow-fermenting compost pits—and shared a long conversation with Elder Sprigg about Pelor. Sprigg questioned whether the sun’s power, which harms their kind, excluded them from Pelor’s grace. Lyra affirmed that Pelor’s light is for all, and that even mortals suffer from overexposure to divine power. When Sprigg asked if one of their sproutlings could be chosen by Pelor, Lyra responded with a clear and resounding yes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Vicas tended to Pinto Gambino, whose magical oath-binding had left him mute. Thankfully, Vicas confirmed that the curse did not prevent Pinto from eating or drinking. The two sat in long silence, and Vicas—perhaps sincerely, perhaps sarcastically—thanked Pinto for being a great listener. Rooker, meanwhile, cast <em>Comprehend Languages</em> and eavesdropped on conversations between Sprigg and other elders. He learned that most of the elders were now dead, and that the vegepygmies feared something they referred to as the Great Skyrock. Their people had little understanding of their origin, but they knew something was coming—and were relying heavily on this new alliance with Ishetar.</p>
<p>In the morning, our heroes met at the Great Toadstool Circle for formal negotiations. Rooker explained that it was not a matter of unwillingness, but rather inability—Ishetar could not continue supplying meat at the previous rate. Sprigg was dismayed, but then admitted he had hoped to renegotiate anyway. He laid out a bold proposal: the vegepygmy village wanted <strong>citizenship</strong>. Not to move, but to become a part of Ishetar’s political structure…to grow together as one colony.</p>
<p>The proposal was met with mixed responses. Thump and Azrael quickly voiced their support: after all, <strong>Ishetar welcomes all</strong>. Vicas and Rooker were more cautious, weighing the political and resource implications. What could the vegepygmies offer in return? Sprigg offered several things: knowledge of the region, spiritual guidance, and a foothold deeper into Ekkorai. And as Lyra and Thump pieced together the truth, it all came clear: the vegepygmies were <strong>not of Astoria at all</strong>. The Great Skyrock was a fragment of their origin. They are extraterrestrial. They dream of joining the world upon which they landed. In the end, it turned out that Sprigg was burying the lede: the Vegepygmies have the capacity to grow vegetables all winter long with seemingly no effort. Ishetar finds themselves in desperate need of reliable food sources with Winter approaching. And so, the deal was sealed; for Ishetar would face a harsh winter without this parthnership.</p>
<p>Rooker and Sprigg shook hands—perhaps forgetting the lingering divine resonance in the Red Vale. Both were branded by a magical symbol: a mycelial network of roots spreading across their palms. The deal was now <em>oath-bound</em>.</p>
<p>As a parting gift, Sprigg offered one more piece of information, not as a diplomat, but as a friend. He told them of a forbidden site to the west: an ancient <strong>slate obelisk</strong>, etched in the Old Tongue (Lyra speculates Sylvan, for it’s what they would have encountered upon landing here), containing the oldest known records of their people. The vegepygmies are forbidden to go there—it is cursed—but if the heroes can translate it, they might recover lost knowledge and uncover powerful relics.</p>
<p>Lyra cured Pinto of his curse, who promptly almost re-applied it in his enthusiasm to sear fealty to Lyra. Thinking it best if they left Pinto behind, the party set off. At the base of the obelisk, they found a battlefield. Rusted weapons lay everywhere, and rows of stacked spears surrounded a massive monument. Impaled atop the tallest pike: a beautiful elven man, seemingly dead? As Rooker detected powerful magic, carrion circling overhead descended, revealing themselves as devils.</p>
<p>The ensuing battle was fierce. Vicas held the line against swarms of sturges, Azrael lit with divine radiance. Lyra invoked the light of Pelor, Thump dropped moonlight from the heavens, and Rooker wielded chaos with <em>Hideous Laughter</em>. Vicas even dragged one of the devils back into the Moonbeam to finish it off. Lyra’s <em>Bless</em> spell turned several misses into hits, and Azrael dealt several blows of truly massive damage, including one turn with a powerful critical hit that turned the tide. In the end, the party was bloodied but victorious.</p>
<p>As the battle raged on, the impaled man began to speak—not to thank them, but to plead with them. He urged them to leave. Called Lyra his judgment. Repeated again and again that there was no saving him. We ended with our heroes standing beneath the pale light of Thump’s moonbeam, staring up at this strange, radiant wretch. As Vicas bluntly asked, <em>“How are you still alive?”</em>—the man’s silence left the question hanging.</p>
